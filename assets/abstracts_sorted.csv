"inactivating mutations in the neurofibromatosis 2 (nf2) tumor suppressor gene results in the development of schwannomas and meningiomas. using nf2deficient meningioma cells and tumors, together with the normal cellular counterparts that meningiomas derive, arachnoid cells, we identified merlin as a novel negative regulator of mtor complex 1 (mtorc1). we now show that merlin positively regulates the kinase activity of mtorc2, a second functionally distinct mtor complex, and that downstream phosphorylation of mtorc2 substrates, including akt, is reduced upon acute merlin deficiency in cells. in response to general growth factor stimulation, akt signaling is attenuated in merlin rna interferencesuppressed human arachnoid and schwann cells by mechanisms mediated by hyperactive mtorc1 and impaired mtorc2. moreover, akt signaling is impaired differentially in a cell typedependent manner in response to distinct growth factor stimuli. however, contrary to activation of mtorc1, the attenuated mtorc2 signaling profiles exhibited by normal arachnoid and schwann cells in response to acute merlin loss were not consistently reflected in nf2deficient meningiomas and schwannomas, suggesting additional genetic events may have been acquired in tumors after initial merlin loss. this finding contrasts with another benign tumor disorder, tuberous sclerosis complex, which exhibits attenuated mtorc2 signaling profiles in both cells and tumors. finally, we examined rapamycin, as well as the mtor kinase inhibitor, torin1, targeting both mtor complexes to identify the most efficacious class of compounds for blocking mtormediated signaling and proliferation in merlindeficient meningioma cells. these studies may ultimately aid in the development of suitable therapeutics for nf2associated tumors. ©2012 aacr.",1406,torin1,meningioma
"meningiomas constitute about 34% of primary intracranial tumors and are associated with increased mortality in patients with neurofibromatosis type 2 (nf2). to evaluate potential medical therapies for these tumors, we have established a quantifiable orthotopic model for nf2deficient meningiomas. we showed that telomeraseimmortalized benmen1 benign meningioma cells harbored a single nucleotide deletion in nf2 exon 7 and did not express the nf2 protein, merlin. we also showed that ar42, a panhistone deacetylase inhibitor, inhibited proliferation of both benmen1 and normal meningeal cells by increasing expression of p16ink4a, p21cip1/waf1, and p27kip1. in addition, ar42 increased proapoptotic bim expression and decreased antiapoptotic bclxl levels. however, ar42 predominantly arrested benmen1 cells at g2m whereas it induced cellcycle arrest at g1 in meningeal cells. consistently, ar42 substantially decreased the levels of cyclin d1, e, and a, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen in meningeal cells while significantly reducing the expression of cyclin b, important for progression through g2, in benmen1 cells. in addition, ar42 decreased aurora a and b expression. to compare the in vivo efficacies of ar42 and ar12, a pdk1 inhibitor, we generated and used luciferaseexpressing benmen1lucb cells to establish intracranial xenografts that grew over time. while ar12 treatment moderately slowed tumor growth, ar42 caused regression of benmen1lucb tumors. importantly, ar42treated tumors showed minimal regrowth when xenograftbearing mice were switched to normal diet. together, these results suggest that ar42 is a potential therapy for meningiomas. the differential effect of ar42 on cellcycle progression of normal meningeal and meningioma cells may have implications for why ar42 is welltolerated while it potently inhibits tumor growth. © 2012 aacr.",4003,ar12,meningioma
"purpose: the purpose was to reevaluate in cell culture models the therapeutic usefulness of some discussed chemotherapies or targeted therapies for meningiomas with a special emphasis on the role of the neurofibromatosis type 2 (nf2) tumor suppressor, which had been neglected so far. in addition, the study intended to evaluate a potential benefit from a treatment with drugs which are well established in other fields of medicine and have been linked recently with tumor disease by epidemiological studies. methods: meningioma cell lines corresponding to various subtypes and pairs of syngenic meningioma cell lines with or without shrnainduced nf2 knockdown were analyzed for their dosedependent response to the drugs in microtiter tetrazolium assays, brdu assays and for selected cases in elisas measuring nucleosome liberation to specifically separate cell death from pure inhibition of cell proliferation. results: we confirmed a moderate efficacy of hydroxyurea (hu) in clinically relevant concentrations. under appropriate dosing, we neither detected major responses to the alkylating compound temozolomide nor to various drugs targeting membrane receptors or enzymes (tamoxifen, erlotinib, mifepristone, losartan, metformin and verapamil). only concentrations far beyond achievable serum levels generated significant effects with the exception of losartan, which showed no effects at all. chemosensitivity varied markedly among meningioma cell lines. importantly, cells with nf2 loss exhibited a significantly higher induction of cell death by hu. conclusions: alternative chemotherapeutic or targeted approaches besides hu have still to be evaluated in further studies, and the role of nf2 must be taken into account. © 2014 springerverlag.",542,erlotinib,meningioma
"neurofibromatosis type 2 ( nf2; mim # 101000) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the development of vestibular schwannomas (vss); schwannomas of other cranial, spinal, and cutaneous nerves; cranial and spinal meningiomas or other central nervous system tumors (eg, ependymomas and astrocytomas) or both. additional features include eye (eg, early onset cataracts, optic nerve sheath meningiomas, retinal or pigment epithelial hamartomas or both, and epithelial retinal membranes) and skin abnormalities (eg, flat dermal [nf2 plaques] or spherical subcutaneous nodular schwannomas or both, and few, atypical caféaulait spots). clinically, children with nf2 fall into 2 main groups: (1) congenital nf2 with bilateral vss detected as early as the first days to months of life, which can be stable or asymptomatic for 12 decades and suddenly progress; and (2) severe prepubertal (wishart type) nf2 with multiple (and rapidly progressive) central nervous system tumors otherthanvs, which usually presents first, years before vss, both associated with more marked skin and eye involvement (vs the classical mild adult [gardner type] nf2, with bilateral vss presenting in young adulthood, sometimes as the only disease feature). individuals manifesting unilateral vs associated with ipsilateral meningiomas or multiple schwannomas localized to a part of the peripheral nervous system have mosaic or segmental nf2; individuals developing multiple nonvs, nonintradermal cranial, spinal, and peripheral schwannomas (histologically proven) have schwannomatosis ( swnts). nf2 is caused by mutations in the nf2 gene at chromosome 22q12.1, which encodes for a protein called merlin or schwannomin, most similar to the exrinreadixinmoesin proteins; mosaic or segmental nf2 is because of mosaic phenomena for the nf2 gene, whereas swnts is caused by germline and possibly mosaic mutations either in the smarcb1 gene (. swnts1; mim # 162091) or the lztr1 gene (swnts2; mim # 615670), both falling within the 22q region. data driven from in vitro and animal studies on the merlin pathway allowed biologically targeted treatment strategies (employing lapatinib, erlotinib, everolimus, picropodophyllin, osu.03012, imatinib, sorafenib, and bevacizumab) aimed at multiple tumor shrinkage or regression or both and tumor arrest of progression with functional improvement.",1549,erlotinib,meningioma
"neurofibromatosis 2 (nf2) is a rare tumor suppressor syndrome that manifests with multiple schwannomas and meningiomas. there are no effective drug therapies for these benign tumors and conventional therapies have limited efficacy. various model systems have been created and several drug targets have been implicated in nf2driven tumorigenesis based on known effects of the absence of merlin, the product of the nf2 gene. we tested priority compounds based on known biology with traditional doseconcentration studies in meningioma and schwann cell systems. concurrently, we studied functional kinome and gene expression in these cells pre and posttreatment to determine merlin deficient molecular phenotypes. cell viability results showed that three agents (gsk2126458, panobinostat, cudc907) had the greatest activity across schwannoma and meningioma cell systems, but merlin status did not significantly influence response. in vivo, drug effect was tumor specific with meningioma, but not schwannoma, showing response to gsk2126458 and panobinostat. in culture, changes in both the transcriptome and kinome in response to treatment clustered predominantly based on tumor type. however, there were differences in both gene expression and functional kinome at baseline between meningioma and schwannoma cell systems that may form the basis for future selective therapies. this work has created an openly accessible resource (www.synapse.org/synodosnf2) of fully characterized isogenic schwannoma and meningioma cell systems as well as a rich data source of kinome and transcriptome data from these assay systems before and after treatment that enables single and combination drug discovery based on molecular phenotype.",355,panobinostat,meningioma
"loss of the tumor suppressor merlin is a cause of frequent tumors of the nervous system, such as schwannomas, meningiomas, and ependymomas, which occur spontaneously or as part of neurofibromatosis type 2 (nf2). because there is medical need for drug therapies for these tumors, our aim is to find therapeutic targets. we have studied the pathobiology of schwannomas, because they are the most common merlindeficient tumors and are a model for all merlindeficient tumors. with use of a human schwannoma in vitro model, we previously described strong overexpression/activation of plateletderived growth factor receptorß (pdgfrb) leading to strong, longlasting activation of extracellularsignal regulated kinase (erk1/2) and akt and increased schwannoma growth, which we successfully inhibited using the pdgfr/raf inhibitor sorafenib. however, the benign character of schwannomas may require longterm treatment; thus, drug tolerability is an issue. with the use of western blotting, proliferation assays, viability assays, and a primary human schwannoma cell in vitro model, we tested the pdgfr/ckit inhibitors imatinib (glivec; novartis) and nilotinib (tasigna; novartis). imatinib and nilotinib inhibited pdgfddmediated erk1/2 activation, basal and pdgfddmediated activation of pdgfrß and akt, and schwannoma proliferation. nilotinib is more potent than imatinib, exerting its maximal inhibitory effect at concentrations lower than steadystate trough plasma levels. in addition, nilotinib combined with the mek1/2 inhibitor selumetinib (azd6244) at low concentrations displayed stronger efficiency toward tumor growth inhibition, compared with nilotinib alone. we suggest that therapy with nilotinib or combinational therapy that simultaneously inhibits pdgfr and the downstream raf/mek1/2/erk1/2 pathway could represent an effective treatment for schwannomas and other merlindeficient tumors. © the author(s) 2011.",870,nilotinib,meningioma

"patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (nf1) and neurofibromatosis type 2 (nf2) are predisposed to tumors of the nervous system. nf1 patients predominantly develop neurofibromas, and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (mpnst) while nf2 patients develop schwannomas and meningiomas. here we quantified the drug sensitivities of nf1 and nf2 tumor cell lines in a high throughput platform. the platform contained a comprehensive collection of inhibitors of mek, raf, ras, farnesyl transferase, pak and erk, representative drugs against many other cancer pathways including wnt, hedgehog, p53, egf, hdac, as well as classical cytotoxic agents recommended for treating mpnst, such as doxorubicin and etoposide. we profiled seven nf1associated mpnst cell lines (st8814, st883, 908, snf02.2, t265, s462ty, snf96.2), one sporadic mpnst cell line (sts26), one schwannoma from a nf2 patient (hei193), one nf2deficient malignant meningioma (kt21mgluc5d), one mouse nf2 schwannoma (sc4) and one sporadic rat schwannoma (rt467 or rt4). nf1 cells were primarily distinguished from nf2 cells and the sporadic mpnst cell line by their sensitivity to mek and erk inhibitors, and to a smaller extent their sensitivity to bh3 mimetics and farnesyl transferase inhibitors. the platform was highly successful in predicting the effects of clinical trials for neurofibromas.",595,doxorubicin,meningioma
"object. highgrade meningiomas in childhood are rare, and their clinical features are unknown. the objective of this study was to determine the clinical characteristics and prognosis of childhood highgrade meningiomas. methods. twentythree patients with childhood highgrade meningiomas were treated at the huashan hospital. clinical data were collected, tumor samples were reexamined, and prognoses were attained through followup visits and telephone interviews. survival probability was calculated using the kaplanmeier method. a 2sided probability level of 0.05 was chosen for statistical significance. results. the series included 18 males and 5 females (mean age 12.1 years). the most common symptoms were headache and vomiting (43%). three patients had accompanying neurofibromatosis type ii (nf2). the highgrade meningioma cases with nf2 had larger tumor diameters than those without nf2 (p = 0.010). the skull base was the most common tumor site (39%). complete resections were achieved in 11 patients after their initial operations. adjuvant radiation therapy was performed in 9 cases. followup evaluations were performed for 20 patients (mean followup 70 months). ten patients experienced recurrences, 2 patients had lung metastases, and 7 patients died of the recurrence. the extent of surgery was significantly related to progressionfree survival (pfs; p = 0.038). a negative progesterone receptor combined with strongly positive bcl2 immunoreactivity was significantly related to pfs (p = 0.001) and overall survival (p = 0.002). the mib1 labeling index was significantly related to overall survival (p = 0.018), whereas postoperative radiation therapy was not significantly related to pfs (p = 0.087) and overall survival (p = 0.40). conclusions. childhood highgrade meningioma is a rare tumor type. childhood highgrade meningioma has a male predominance and the basilar region is the most common tumor location. patients with these tumors have high recurrence and mortality rates. the extent of resection is an important prognosis factor. a negative progesterone receptor combined with a strongly positive bcl2 immunoreaction might predict cancer recurrence. the mib1 labeling index correlates with the prognosis, and an mib1 labeling index < 3% increases the risk of recurrence in childhood highgrade meningioma. more cases should be collected, and longer followup periods should be obtained, to evaluate the effects of postoperative radiation therapy in childhood highgrade meningioma. © 19442012 american association of neurological surgeons.",821,progesterone,meningioma
"objectives: spinal meningiomas mainly occur in old patients, with a remarkable female prevalence. this study investigates the different features between younger and older patients in an adult population (>18 years). materials and methods: a surgical series of 120 adult patients operated on for spinal meningiomas at the neurosurgical clinic of the ""federico ii"" university of naples is reviewed. in this series 117 patients with a sporadic spinal meningioma were divided in two groups: group i including 30 patients (25.6%) younger than 50 years of age, group ii including 87 patients (74.4%) older than 50 years. 3 patients had a spinal meningioma and neurofibromatosis. several parameters, including sex, predisposing factors, tumor location and growth, histology, recurrences, proliferation index ki67 li, and outcome, are considered and compared in the two age groups. results: group i showed an incidence of high cervical spine (c1c4) meningiomas higher than group ii (23.3% vs 3.4%, p = 0.026) and lower rate of thoracic tumors (60% vs 82.7%, p = 0.04). no significant differences of histological type and ki67 li were found. group i had 2 cases of atypical meningiomas (6.6% vs 0%, ns). recurrences occurred in 6.6% of group i and 2.6% of group ii, with no significance. in recurrent meningiomas values of ki67 li were significantly higher than values in not recurrent meningiomas (p = 0.0001), whereas no difference of estrogen and progesterone receptor expression was noted. conclusions: younger adult patients with spinal meningiomas show not rare occurrence of nf (9%) and significantly higher incidence of high cervical and lower incidence of thoracic localizations with respect to the older patients. on the other hand, there are not significant differences of histology, ki67 li and recurrence rate, excepting for a slight difference for atypical meningiomas. © 2010 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.",903,progesterone,meningioma
"background: the pathogenesis of meningioma in females and its association with exogenous progesterone is remained unclear. this study was aimed to examine expression of progesterone receptor (pr) and neurofibromatosis2 (nf2) and assess their relationships to history of exogenous progesterone use and risk of meningioma. methods: our study was a casecontrol study that involves 115 females, 40 cases who diagnosed with orbitocranial meningioma and 75 controls of healthy, that has been presented in previous study. the demographic characteristics, reproductive factors, and history of progesterone use were obtained indepth facetoface interviews. pr and nf2 mrna were assessed by realtime quantitative polymerase chain reaction (rtqpcr) on serum specimens. results: the mean age of participants in cases vs. controls were 46.6 ± 6.2 vs. 46.5 ± 7.45 (p = 0.969). the expression of pr and nf2 in cases was significantly lower than in controls. the longer duration of progesterone exposure was significantly associated with lower expression of pr and nf2. significant association between lower expression of pr (or 11.7; 95% ci 4.1732.9; p < 0.001 comparing the lowest quartile vs. 3 highest quartile of pr) and nf2 (or 4.23; 95% ci 1.859.67; p = 0.001 comparing the 2 lowest quartiles vs. 2 highest quartiles) with increased risk of meningioma were also reported. conclusion: in this study we showed that the longer the exposure to exogenous progesterone, the lower the expression of pr and nf2 mrna in the serum. low expression of pr and nf2 were associated with higher risk of meningioma, suggesting that low pr expression and inactivation of nf2 might play a key role in progesteroneassociated meningioma tumorigenesis and may be potential clinical marker for females at higher risk of meningioma.",1921,progesterone,meningioma

"opinion statement: neurofibromatosis type 1 (nf1) and type 2 (nf2) are genetically and medically distinct neurocutaneous disorders that are both associated with tumors affecting the central and peripheral nervous systems. nf1 has a frequency of 1 in 3,000, compared with 1 in 30,000 for nf2. careful surveillance is important for both conditions, to allow early identification and treatment of complications. the most common and important problems in nf1 are cognitive impairment, optic pathway gliomas, plexiform neurofibromas, and orthopaedic issues. early intervention and tailored educational programs are indicated for learning difficulties. attention deficit hyperactivity disorder may be amenable to treatment with stimulant medication. a clinical trial is under way to evaluate lovastatin in the treatment of cognitive problems in children with nf1. chemotherapy with vincristine and carboplatin is the current standard of care for symptomatic optic pathway gliomas, but new agents with improved efficacy are needed. plexiform neurofibromas may be treated with surgery, but often recur. to date, no medical therapy has proven effective in limiting plexiform neurofibroma growth, but several candidate medications are under consideration in clinical trials. malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors may arise in preexisting plexiform neurofibromas, so changes in tumor growth or an increase in pain or focal neurologic deficit should prompt further investigation and early treatment with wide surgical resection, with or without adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy. specialist surgical intervention may be needed for scoliosis and tibial pseudoarthrosis. in nf2, surgical treatment remains a cornerstone of management for symptomatic progressive vestibular schwannomas, meningiomas, and spinal tumors. vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors show promise for the treatment of vestibular schwannomas, with the aim of delaying surgery, and other targeted molecular therapies are becoming available as investigational options. hearing aids and brainstem and cochlear implants have a role in optimizing functional hearing in some patients. specialist ophthalmology input should be arranged to monitor for ophthalmologic complications. a coordinated effort is needed to enroll nf1 and nf2 patients in international multicenter clinical trials of promising new pharmacologic agents. genetic testing is useful for prenatal diagnosis and may be important in understanding individual responses to novel medical therapies in the future. effective transition to adult services is important, considering the likelihood of further complications in the adult years. © 2011 springer science+business media, llc.",4591,lovastatin,meningioma

"background. meningiomas are the most common primary brain tumor in adults, and somatic loss of the neurofibromatosis 2 (nf2) tumor suppressor gene is a frequent genetic event. there is no effective treatment for tumors that recur or continue to grow despite surgery and/or radiation. therefore, targeted therapies that either delay tumor progression or cause tumor shrinkage are much needed. our earlier work established mammalian target of rapamycin complex mtorc1/mtorc2 activation in nf2deficient meningiomas. methods. highthroughput kinome analyses were performed in nf2null human arachnoidal and meningioma cell lines to identify functional kinome changes upon nf2 loss. immunoblotting confirmed the activation of kinases and demonstrated effectiveness of drugs to block the activation. drugs, singly and in combination, were screened in cells for their growth inhibitory activity. antitumor drug efficacy was tested in an orthotopic meningioma model. results. erythropoietinproducing hepatocellular receptor tyrosine kinases (eph rtks), ckit, and src family kinase (sfk) members, which are biological targets of dasatinib, were among the top candidates activated in nf2null cells. dasatinib significantly inhibited phosphoeph receptor a2 (pepha2), pephb1, ckit, and src/sfk in nf2null cells, showing no crosstalk with mtorc1/2 signaling. posttreatment kinome analyses showed minimal adaptive changes. while dasatinib treatment showed some activity, dual mtorc1/2 inhibitor and its combination with dasatinib elicited stronger growth inhibition in meningiomas. conclusion. cotargeting mtorc1/2 and eph rtk/sfk pathways could be a novel effective treatment strategy for nf2deficient meningiomas.",2053,dasatinib,meningioma

"loss of the tumor suppressor merlin causes development of the tumors of the nervous system, such as schwannomas, meningiomas, and ependymomas occurring spontaneously or as part of a hereditary disease neurofibromatosis type 2 (nf2). current therapies, (radio) surgery, are not always effective. therefore, there is a need for drug treatments for these tumors. schwannomas are the most frequent of merlindeficient tumors and are hallmark for nf2. using our in vitro human schwannoma model, we demonstrated that merlindeficiency leads to increased proliferation, cellmatrix adhesion, and survival. increased proliferation due to strong activation of extracellularsignalregulated kinase 1/2 (erk1/2) is caused by overexpression/activation of plateletderived growth factor receptorβ (pdgfrβ) and erbb2/3 which we successfully blocked with azd6244, sorafenib, or lapatinib. schwannoma basal proliferation is, however, only partly dependent on pdgfrβ and is completely independent of erbb2/3. moreover, the mechanisms underlying pathological cellmatrix adhesion and survival of schwannoma cells are still not fully understood. here, we demonstrate that insulinlike growth factori receptor (igfir) is strongly overexpressed and activated in human primary schwannoma cells. igfi and ii are overexpressed and released from schwannoma cells. we show that erk1/2 is relevant for igfimediated increase in proliferation and cellmatrix adhesion, cjun nterminal kinases for increased proliferation and akt for survival. we demonstrate new mechanisms involved in increased basal proliferation, cellmatrix adhesion, and survival of schwannoma cells. we identified therapeutic targets igfir and downstream pi3k for treatment of schwannoma and other merlindeficient tumors and show usefulness of small molecule inhibitors in our model. pi3k is relevant for both igfir and previously described pdgfrβ signaling in schwannoma. © 2012 wiley periodicals, inc.",683,apatinib,meningioma

"methylation of the neurofibromatosis type 2 (nf2) gene in lowgrade meningioma (who grade i) has crucial roles in tumorigenesis and development. meningioma formation might also occur in the setting of an inflammatory microenvironment. however, the association between inflammation and the methylation of nf2 remains unclear. the present study investigates the role and regulatory mechanism of il1β, one of the most important proinflammatory cytokines, in the methylation of nf2 in benign meningioma. three primary lowgrade meningioma cells and leptomeningeal cells were cultured. cck8 and brdu assays demonstrated that proliferation of meningioma/leptomeningeal cells treated with il1β occurred in a dose and timedependent manner. methylationspecific pcr verified that il1β induced methylation of the nf2 promoter and decreased nf2/merlin expression in meningioma/leptomeningeal cells. realtime pcr, western blotting, and immunofluorescence showed that il1β upregulated dnmt1 in meningioma cells and dnmt1/3b in leptomeningeal cells but did not upregulate dnmt3a. after cotreatment with the dnmt inhibitor 5aza2′deoxycytidine and dnmt sirna, methylation of nf2 induced by il1β was attenuated and merlin expression was restored. furthermore, we showed that dnmt1 in meningiomas and dnmt1/3b in leptomeninges were regulated via activation of the mapk (p38, erk, jnk) and nfκb pathways. these results suggest that il1β induces methylation of nf2 by upregulating dnmt1 in benign meningioma cells and dnmt1/3b in leptomeningeal cells via mapk and nfκb pathways. therefore, nf2 methylation is a linker between il1β and tumor development, and dnmts might be potential therapeutic targets in meningioma for regulating nf2 and inhibiting tumor development. © 2016 wiley periodicals, inc.",1499,cytidine,meningioma
"meningiomas are the most common primary intracranial adult tumor. all neurofibromatosis 2 (nf2)associated meningiomas and ~60% of sporadic meningiomas show loss of nf2 tumor suppressor protein. there are no effective medical therapies for progressive and recurrent meningiomas. our previous work demonstrated aberrant activation of mtorc1 signaling that led to ongoing clinical trials with rapamycin analogs for nf2 and sporadic meningioma patients. here we performed a highthroughput kinome screen to identify kinases responsible for mtorc1 pathway activation in nf2deficient meningioma cells. among the emerging top candidates were the mtorc2specific target serum/glucocorticoidregulated kinase 1 (sgk1) and p21activated kinase 1 (pak1). in nf2deficient meningioma cells, inhibition of sgk1 rescues mtorc1 activation, and sgk1 activation is sensitive to dual mtorc1/2 inhibitor azd2014, but not to rapamycin. pak1 inhibition also leads to attenuated mtorc1 but not mtorc2 signaling, suggesting that mtorc2/ sgk1 and rac1/pak1 pathways are independently responsible for mtorc1 activation in nf2deficient meningiomas. using crisprcas9 genome editing, we generated isogenic human arachnoidal cell lines (acs), the origin cell type for meningiomas, expressing or lacking nf2. nf2null crispr acs recapitulate the signaling of nf2 deficient meningioma cells. interestingly, we observe increased sgk1 transcription and protein expression in nf2crispr acs and in primary nf2negative meningioma lines. moreover, we demonstrate that the dual mtorc1/mtorc2 inhibitor, azd2014 is superior to rapamycin and pak inhibitor frax597 in blocking proliferation of meningioma cells. importantly, azd2014 is currently in use in several clinical trials of cancer. therefore, we believe that azd2014 may provide therapeutic advantage over rapalogs for recurrent and progressive meningiomas.",4490,azd2014,meningioma

"opinion statement: neurofibromatosis type 1 (nf1) and type 2 (nf2) are genetically and medically distinct neurocutaneous disorders that are both associated with tumors affecting the central and peripheral nervous systems. nf1 has a frequency of 1 in 3,000, compared with 1 in 30,000 for nf2. careful surveillance is important for both conditions, to allow early identification and treatment of complications. the most common and important problems in nf1 are cognitive impairment, optic pathway gliomas, plexiform neurofibromas, and orthopaedic issues. early intervention and tailored educational programs are indicated for learning difficulties. attention deficit hyperactivity disorder may be amenable to treatment with stimulant medication. a clinical trial is under way to evaluate lovastatin in the treatment of cognitive problems in children with nf1. chemotherapy with vincristine and carboplatin is the current standard of care for symptomatic optic pathway gliomas, but new agents with improved efficacy are needed. plexiform neurofibromas may be treated with surgery, but often recur. to date, no medical therapy has proven effective in limiting plexiform neurofibroma growth, but several candidate medications are under consideration in clinical trials. malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors may arise in preexisting plexiform neurofibromas, so changes in tumor growth or an increase in pain or focal neurologic deficit should prompt further investigation and early treatment with wide surgical resection, with or without adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy. specialist surgical intervention may be needed for scoliosis and tibial pseudoarthrosis. in nf2, surgical treatment remains a cornerstone of management for symptomatic progressive vestibular schwannomas, meningiomas, and spinal tumors. vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors show promise for the treatment of vestibular schwannomas, with the aim of delaying surgery, and other targeted molecular therapies are becoming available as investigational options. hearing aids and brainstem and cochlear implants have a role in optimizing functional hearing in some patients. specialist ophthalmology input should be arranged to monitor for ophthalmologic complications. a coordinated effort is needed to enroll nf1 and nf2 patients in international multicenter clinical trials of promising new pharmacologic agents. genetic testing is useful for prenatal diagnosis and may be important in understanding individual responses to novel medical therapies in the future. effective transition to adult services is important, considering the likelihood of further complications in the adult years. © 2011 springer science+business media, llc.",4591,vincristine,meningioma

"patients with bilateral vestibular schwannomas associated with neurofibromatosis type 2 (nf2) experience significant morbidity such as complete hearing loss. we have recently shown that treatment with bevacizumab provided tumor stabilization and hearing recovery in a subset of nf2 patients with progressive disease. in the current study, we used two animal models to identify the mechanism of action of antivascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) therapy in schwannomas. the human hei193 and murine nf2/ cell lines were implanted between the pia and arachnoid meninges as well as in the sciatic nerve to mimic central and peripheral schwannomas. mice were treated with bevacizumab (10 mg/kg/wk i.v.) or vandetanib (50 mg/kg/d orally) to block the vegf pathway. using intravital and confocal microscopy, together with wholebody imaging, we measured tumor growth delay, survival rate, as well as blood vessel structure and function at regular intervals. in both models, tumor vessel diameter, length/surface area density, and permeability were significantly reduced after treatment. after 2 weeks of treatment, necrosis in hei193 tumors and apoptosis in nf2/ tumors were significantly increased, and the tumor growth rate decreased by an average of 50%. the survival of mice bearing intracranial schwannomas was extended by at least 50%. this study shows that antivegf therapy normalizes the vasculature of schwannoma xenografts in nude mice and successfully controls the tumor growth, probably by reestablishing a natural balance between vegf and semaphorin 3 signaling. ©2010 aacr.",2886,vandetanib,schwannoma
"inactivating mutations in the neurofibromatosis 2 (nf2) tumor suppressor gene results in the development of schwannomas and meningiomas. using nf2deficient meningioma cells and tumors, together with the normal cellular counterparts that meningiomas derive, arachnoid cells, we identified merlin as a novel negative regulator of mtor complex 1 (mtorc1). we now show that merlin positively regulates the kinase activity of mtorc2, a second functionally distinct mtor complex, and that downstream phosphorylation of mtorc2 substrates, including akt, is reduced upon acute merlin deficiency in cells. in response to general growth factor stimulation, akt signaling is attenuated in merlin rna interferencesuppressed human arachnoid and schwann cells by mechanisms mediated by hyperactive mtorc1 and impaired mtorc2. moreover, akt signaling is impaired differentially in a cell typedependent manner in response to distinct growth factor stimuli. however, contrary to activation of mtorc1, the attenuated mtorc2 signaling profiles exhibited by normal arachnoid and schwann cells in response to acute merlin loss were not consistently reflected in nf2deficient meningiomas and schwannomas, suggesting additional genetic events may have been acquired in tumors after initial merlin loss. this finding contrasts with another benign tumor disorder, tuberous sclerosis complex, which exhibits attenuated mtorc2 signaling profiles in both cells and tumors. finally, we examined rapamycin, as well as the mtor kinase inhibitor, torin1, targeting both mtor complexes to identify the most efficacious class of compounds for blocking mtormediated signaling and proliferation in merlindeficient meningioma cells. these studies may ultimately aid in the development of suitable therapeutics for nf2associated tumors. ©2012 aacr.",1406,torin1,schwannoma

"a 72yearold caucasian man incurring a prostate hypertrophy presented with a right forearm nodule, the growth of which appeared to parallel the rise in his blood prostatespecific antigen (psa) level. echographic examination was consistent with a mediannerve schwannoma, and was confirmed upon magnetic resonance imaging (mri). excision of the nodule was readily performed without significant neural damage, and its schwannoma nature was confirmed upon immunohistochemistry analysis. importantly, blood psa dropped abruptly from ≈13 to ≈5 ng/ml within 2 months postschwannoma resection, a swift drastic reduction unachievable with oral dutasteride alone. however, 6 weeks later, a new nodule became apparent on the back of the left knee and was identified as a second schwannoma, thereby suggesting that its growth could have been stimulated by the resection of the first schwannoma, as previously described for vestibular schwannomas. the second schwannoma was in fact two: the bigger one was in the common fibular nerve and the smaller one in the tibial nerve. both echography and mri results were confirmed upon surgical resection of the bigger knee schwannoma. although the third schwannoma has not yet been resected and formally characterized, we face a schwannomatosis case with an unexpected potential exosomemediated stimulating effect on psa secretion (psa immunohistochemistry was negative on both schwannomas). on the other hand, preliminary genomic analysis showed a deficient balance for chromosome 22, the very chromosome carrying the three main genes involved in schwannomatosis. this agerelated schwannomatosis case is thus discussed in light of the following: agerelated dna repair deficiency culminating in loss of chromosome/heterozygosity; cpg methylation/demethylationbased epigenetic aging; agerelated functional decline of the immune system responsible for inefficient elimination of abnormal cells and subsequent tumorigenic cell turnover; exosomemediated pathologic intercellular communications; and prostateinvading brain neural progenitors as pathologic peripheral nervous system (pns) cells.",4338,dutasteride,schwannoma
"opinion statement: neurofibromatosis type 1 (nf1) and type 2 (nf2) are genetically and medically distinct neurocutaneous disorders that are both associated with tumors affecting the central and peripheral nervous systems. nf1 has a frequency of 1 in 3,000, compared with 1 in 30,000 for nf2. careful surveillance is important for both conditions, to allow early identification and treatment of complications. the most common and important problems in nf1 are cognitive impairment, optic pathway gliomas, plexiform neurofibromas, and orthopaedic issues. early intervention and tailored educational programs are indicated for learning difficulties. attention deficit hyperactivity disorder may be amenable to treatment with stimulant medication. a clinical trial is under way to evaluate lovastatin in the treatment of cognitive problems in children with nf1. chemotherapy with vincristine and carboplatin is the current standard of care for symptomatic optic pathway gliomas, but new agents with improved efficacy are needed. plexiform neurofibromas may be treated with surgery, but often recur. to date, no medical therapy has proven effective in limiting plexiform neurofibroma growth, but several candidate medications are under consideration in clinical trials. malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors may arise in preexisting plexiform neurofibromas, so changes in tumor growth or an increase in pain or focal neurologic deficit should prompt further investigation and early treatment with wide surgical resection, with or without adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy. specialist surgical intervention may be needed for scoliosis and tibial pseudoarthrosis. in nf2, surgical treatment remains a cornerstone of management for symptomatic progressive vestibular schwannomas, meningiomas, and spinal tumors. vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors show promise for the treatment of vestibular schwannomas, with the aim of delaying surgery, and other targeted molecular therapies are becoming available as investigational options. hearing aids and brainstem and cochlear implants have a role in optimizing functional hearing in some patients. specialist ophthalmology input should be arranged to monitor for ophthalmologic complications. a coordinated effort is needed to enroll nf1 and nf2 patients in international multicenter clinical trials of promising new pharmacologic agents. genetic testing is useful for prenatal diagnosis and may be important in understanding individual responses to novel medical therapies in the future. effective transition to adult services is important, considering the likelihood of further complications in the adult years. © 2011 springer science+business media, llc.",4591,lovastatin,schwannoma

"loss of the tumor suppressor merlin causes development of the tumors of the nervous system, such as schwannomas, meningiomas, and ependymomas occurring spontaneously or as part of a hereditary disease neurofibromatosis type 2 (nf2). current therapies, (radio) surgery, are not always effective. therefore, there is a need for drug treatments for these tumors. schwannomas are the most frequent of merlindeficient tumors and are hallmark for nf2. using our in vitro human schwannoma model, we demonstrated that merlindeficiency leads to increased proliferation, cellmatrix adhesion, and survival. increased proliferation due to strong activation of extracellularsignalregulated kinase 1/2 (erk1/2) is caused by overexpression/activation of plateletderived growth factor receptorβ (pdgfrβ) and erbb2/3 which we successfully blocked with azd6244, sorafenib, or lapatinib. schwannoma basal proliferation is, however, only partly dependent on pdgfrβ and is completely independent of erbb2/3. moreover, the mechanisms underlying pathological cellmatrix adhesion and survival of schwannoma cells are still not fully understood. here, we demonstrate that insulinlike growth factori receptor (igfir) is strongly overexpressed and activated in human primary schwannoma cells. igfi and ii are overexpressed and released from schwannoma cells. we show that erk1/2 is relevant for igfimediated increase in proliferation and cellmatrix adhesion, cjun nterminal kinases for increased proliferation and akt for survival. we demonstrate new mechanisms involved in increased basal proliferation, cellmatrix adhesion, and survival of schwannoma cells. we identified therapeutic targets igfir and downstream pi3k for treatment of schwannoma and other merlindeficient tumors and show usefulness of small molecule inhibitors in our model. pi3k is relevant for both igfir and previously described pdgfrβ signaling in schwannoma. © 2012 wiley periodicals, inc.",683,lapatinib,schwannoma
"neurofibromatosis type 2 ( nf2; mim # 101000) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the development of vestibular schwannomas (vss); schwannomas of other cranial, spinal, and cutaneous nerves; cranial and spinal meningiomas or other central nervous system tumors (eg, ependymomas and astrocytomas) or both. additional features include eye (eg, early onset cataracts, optic nerve sheath meningiomas, retinal or pigment epithelial hamartomas or both, and epithelial retinal membranes) and skin abnormalities (eg, flat dermal [nf2 plaques] or spherical subcutaneous nodular schwannomas or both, and few, atypical caféaulait spots). clinically, children with nf2 fall into 2 main groups: (1) congenital nf2 with bilateral vss detected as early as the first days to months of life, which can be stable or asymptomatic for 12 decades and suddenly progress; and (2) severe prepubertal (wishart type) nf2 with multiple (and rapidly progressive) central nervous system tumors otherthanvs, which usually presents first, years before vss, both associated with more marked skin and eye involvement (vs the classical mild adult [gardner type] nf2, with bilateral vss presenting in young adulthood, sometimes as the only disease feature). individuals manifesting unilateral vs associated with ipsilateral meningiomas or multiple schwannomas localized to a part of the peripheral nervous system have mosaic or segmental nf2; individuals developing multiple nonvs, nonintradermal cranial, spinal, and peripheral schwannomas (histologically proven) have schwannomatosis ( swnts). nf2 is caused by mutations in the nf2 gene at chromosome 22q12.1, which encodes for a protein called merlin or schwannomin, most similar to the exrinreadixinmoesin proteins; mosaic or segmental nf2 is because of mosaic phenomena for the nf2 gene, whereas swnts is caused by germline and possibly mosaic mutations either in the smarcb1 gene (. swnts1; mim # 162091) or the lztr1 gene (swnts2; mim # 615670), both falling within the 22q region. data driven from in vitro and animal studies on the merlin pathway allowed biologically targeted treatment strategies (employing lapatinib, erlotinib, everolimus, picropodophyllin, osu.03012, imatinib, sorafenib, and bevacizumab) aimed at multiple tumor shrinkage or regression or both and tumor arrest of progression with functional improvement.",1549,lapatinib,schwannoma

"vestibular schwannomas (vs) arising sporadically or in patients with neurofibromatosis type 2 (nf2) consistently lack expression of merlin, a tumor suppressor. conventional treatment options include surgery and radiotherapy but there is no validated medical option. recent evidence suggests that merlin deficiency may result in abnormal activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (rtks) and downstream signaling, promoting tumor growth. although smallmolecule rtk inhibitors are widely available for clinical use, no such therapy has been validated in patients with vs. to screen for rtk activation, surgical vs specimens from patients with and without nf2 were analyzed by phosphortk profiling arrays. downstream signaling pathway activation was analyzed by phosphomapk arrays. activated rtks and downstream kinases were validated immunohistochemically in corresponding formalinfixed, paraffinembedded tissues. phosphortk arrays and immunohistochemistry showed consistent overexpression and activation of egfr family receptors and evidence of erk1/2 downstream signaling was observed in all samples analyzed (n = 11). based on the findings, the smallmolecule egfr/erbb2 kinase inhibitor lapatinib was selected for evaluation of target inhibition and treatment efficacy in our in vitro human schwannoma model. egfr/erbb2 targeted therapy with lapatinib inhibited erbb2 phosphorylation and survivin upregulation, as well as downstream erk1/2 and akt activation, resulting in decreased proliferation. we conclude that egfr family receptor activation is a consistent feature of both sporadic and nf2related vs. molecular targeted therapy with lapatinib downregulates survivin and has antiproliferative activity in a preclinical vs model. based on these findings, a clinical trial with lapatinib for the treatment of vs is currently underway. © the author(s) 2010.",2696,lapatinib,schwannoma

"objective: to describe the clinical presentation, localization modalities, and management of patients with tumorinduced osteomalacia (tio).methods: we performed a retrospective analysis of case records of patients diagnosed with tio between january 1996 and march 2010 at our institution in mumbai, india.results: nine patients (6 female and 3 male) with a mean age of 37.5 ± 17.5 years with biochemical and imaging evidence of tio were included in the study. overall, patients presented with proximal muscle weakness and pain. three patients had neurofibromatosis 1, one had isolated schwannoma, and one had epidermal nevus syndrome. the mean delay in diagnosis was 7.67 years. biochemical studies revealed normal serum calcium (mean, 9.2 ± 0.8 mg/dl), low serum phosphorus (mean, 1.36 ± 0.54 mg/dl), and low maximal tubular reabsorption of phosphorus factored for glomerular filtration rate (mean, 0.94 ± 0.49 mg/dl). fibroblast growth factor23 was increased in 3 of the patients without neurofibromatosis but was normal or nearnormal in all the patients with neurofibromas. a fludeoxyglucose f 18 positron emission tomography (fdg pet) scan helped to localize the tumors in 4 of the 5 patients with diagnoses other than neurofibromatosis. three patients underwent surgical excision and were cured. one patient underwent biopsy and partial excision. histopathologic findings were suggestive of phosphaturic mesenchymal tumor, benign fibrous histiocytoma, nonossifying fibroma, and sciatic nerve schwannoma.conclusion: there is a wellknown delay in the diagnosis of tio. fdg pet is a useful modality for localization of tumors. preoperative localization increases the odds for cure after surgical excision. copyright © 2011 aace.",106,morin,schwannoma
"neurofibromatosis type ii (nf2) is a disease that needs new solutions. vestibular schwannoma (vs) growth causes progressive hearing loss, and the standard treatment, including surgery and radiotherapy, can further damage the nerve. there is an urgent need to identify an adjunct therapy that, by enhancing the efficacy of radiation, can help lower the radiation dose and preserve hearing. the mechanisms underlying deafness in nf2 are still unclear. one of the major limitations in studying tumorinduced hearing loss is the lack of mouse models that allow hearing testing. here, we developed a cerebellopontine angle (cpa) schwannoma model that faithfully recapitulates the tumorinduced hearing loss. using this model, we discovered that cmet blockade by crizotinib (crz) enhanced schwannoma radiosensitivity by enhancing dna damage, and crz treatment combined with lowdose radiation was as effective as highdose radiation. crz treatment had no adverse effect on hearing; however, it did not affect tumorinduced hearing loss, presumably because cmet blockade did not change tumor hepatocyte growth factor (hgf) levels. this cmet gene knockdown study independently confirmed the role of the cmet pathway in mediating the effect of crz. furthermore, we evaluated the translational potential of cmet blockade in human schwannomas. we found that human nf2associated and sporadic vss showed significantly elevated hgf expression and cmet activation compared with normal nerves, which correlated with tumor growth and cyst formation. using organoid brain slice culture, cmet blockade inhibited the growth of patientderived schwannomas. our findings provide the rationale and necessary data for the clinical translation of combined cmet blockade with radiation therapy in patients with nf2.",1533,morin,schwannoma
"neurofibromatosis type 2 (nf2) is a nervous system tumor disorder caused by inactivation of the merlin tumor suppressor encoded by the nf2 gene. bilateral vestibular schwannomas are a diagnostic hallmark of nf2. mainstream treatment options for nf2associated tumors have been limited to surgery and radiotherapy; however, offlabel uses of targeted molecular therapies are becoming increasingly common. here, we investigated drugs targeting two kinases activated in nf2associated schwannomas, cmet and src. we demonstrated that merlindeficient mouse schwann cells (mdmsc) treated with the cmet inhibitor, cabozantinib, or the src kinase inhibitors, dasatinib and saracatinib, underwent a g1 cellcycle arrest. however, when mdmscs were treated with a combination of cabozantinib and saracatinib, they exhibited caspasedependent apoptosis. the combination therapy also significantly reduced growth of mdmscs in an orthotopic allograft mouse model by greater than 80% of vehicle. moreover, human vestibular schwannoma cells with nf2 mutations had a 40% decrease in cell viability when treated with cabozantinib and saracatinib together compared with the vehicle control. this study demonstrates that simultaneous inhibition of cmet and src signaling in mdmscs triggers apoptosis and reveals vulnerable pathways that could be exploited to develop nf2 therapies.",1370,dasatinib,schwannoma
"patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (nf1) and neurofibromatosis type 2 (nf2) are predisposed to tumors of the nervous system. nf1 patients predominantly develop neurofibromas, and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (mpnst) while nf2 patients develop schwannomas and meningiomas. here we quantified the drug sensitivities of nf1 and nf2 tumor cell lines in a high throughput platform. the platform contained a comprehensive collection of inhibitors of mek, raf, ras, farnesyl transferase, pak and erk, representative drugs against many other cancer pathways including wnt, hedgehog, p53, egf, hdac, as well as classical cytotoxic agents recommended for treating mpnst, such as doxorubicin and etoposide. we profiled seven nf1associated mpnst cell lines (st8814, st883, 908, snf02.2, t265, s462ty, snf96.2), one sporadic mpnst cell line (sts26), one schwannoma from a nf2 patient (hei193), one nf2deficient malignant meningioma (kt21mgluc5d), one mouse nf2 schwannoma (sc4) and one sporadic rat schwannoma (rt467 or rt4). nf1 cells were primarily distinguished from nf2 cells and the sporadic mpnst cell line by their sensitivity to mek and erk inhibitors, and to a smaller extent their sensitivity to bh3 mimetics and farnesyl transferase inhibitors. the platform was highly successful in predicting the effects of clinical trials for neurofibromas.",595,etoposide,schwannoma
"loss of the tumor suppressor merlin causes development of the tumors of the nervous system, such as schwannomas, meningiomas, and ependymomas occurring spontaneously or as part of a hereditary disease neurofibromatosis type 2 (nf2). current therapies, (radio) surgery, are not always effective. therefore, there is a need for drug treatments for these tumors. schwannomas are the most frequent of merlindeficient tumors and are hallmark for nf2. using our in vitro human schwannoma model, we demonstrated that merlindeficiency leads to increased proliferation, cellmatrix adhesion, and survival. increased proliferation due to strong activation of extracellularsignalregulated kinase 1/2 (erk1/2) is caused by overexpression/activation of plateletderived growth factor receptorβ (pdgfrβ) and erbb2/3 which we successfully blocked with azd6244, sorafenib, or lapatinib. schwannoma basal proliferation is, however, only partly dependent on pdgfrβ and is completely independent of erbb2/3. moreover, the mechanisms underlying pathological cellmatrix adhesion and survival of schwannoma cells are still not fully understood. here, we demonstrate that insulinlike growth factori receptor (igfir) is strongly overexpressed and activated in human primary schwannoma cells. igfi and ii are overexpressed and released from schwannoma cells. we show that erk1/2 is relevant for igfimediated increase in proliferation and cellmatrix adhesion, cjun nterminal kinases for increased proliferation and akt for survival. we demonstrate new mechanisms involved in increased basal proliferation, cellmatrix adhesion, and survival of schwannoma cells. we identified therapeutic targets igfir and downstream pi3k for treatment of schwannoma and other merlindeficient tumors and show usefulness of small molecule inhibitors in our model. pi3k is relevant for both igfir and previously described pdgfrβ signaling in schwannoma. © 2012 wiley periodicals, inc.",683,apatinib,schwannoma
"neurofibromatosis type 2 ( nf2; mim # 101000) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the development of vestibular schwannomas (vss); schwannomas of other cranial, spinal, and cutaneous nerves; cranial and spinal meningiomas or other central nervous system tumors (eg, ependymomas and astrocytomas) or both. additional features include eye (eg, early onset cataracts, optic nerve sheath meningiomas, retinal or pigment epithelial hamartomas or both, and epithelial retinal membranes) and skin abnormalities (eg, flat dermal [nf2 plaques] or spherical subcutaneous nodular schwannomas or both, and few, atypical caféaulait spots). clinically, children with nf2 fall into 2 main groups: (1) congenital nf2 with bilateral vss detected as early as the first days to months of life, which can be stable or asymptomatic for 12 decades and suddenly progress; and (2) severe prepubertal (wishart type) nf2 with multiple (and rapidly progressive) central nervous system tumors otherthanvs, which usually presents first, years before vss, both associated with more marked skin and eye involvement (vs the classical mild adult [gardner type] nf2, with bilateral vss presenting in young adulthood, sometimes as the only disease feature). individuals manifesting unilateral vs associated with ipsilateral meningiomas or multiple schwannomas localized to a part of the peripheral nervous system have mosaic or segmental nf2; individuals developing multiple nonvs, nonintradermal cranial, spinal, and peripheral schwannomas (histologically proven) have schwannomatosis ( swnts). nf2 is caused by mutations in the nf2 gene at chromosome 22q12.1, which encodes for a protein called merlin or schwannomin, most similar to the exrinreadixinmoesin proteins; mosaic or segmental nf2 is because of mosaic phenomena for the nf2 gene, whereas swnts is caused by germline and possibly mosaic mutations either in the smarcb1 gene (. swnts1; mim # 162091) or the lztr1 gene (swnts2; mim # 615670), both falling within the 22q region. data driven from in vitro and animal studies on the merlin pathway allowed biologically targeted treatment strategies (employing lapatinib, erlotinib, everolimus, picropodophyllin, osu.03012, imatinib, sorafenib, and bevacizumab) aimed at multiple tumor shrinkage or regression or both and tumor arrest of progression with functional improvement.",1549,apatinib,schwannoma

"the understanding of the molecular pathways underlying tumor development in neurofibromatosis type 2 (nf2) is increasing. thus, repositioning drugs, drug therapies that are already clinically available for various cancers, appear potentially promising for nf2 patients. based on preclinical data from in vitro or animal models, five different treatments have been proposed for selected nf2 cases. evaluation of bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody against vegf has mainly been reported in retrospective studies; it has been reported to induce hearing improvement and tumor shrinkage in more than 50% of progressive vestibular schwannomas (vs). in our experience with 16 patients, bevacizumab is associated with an increase of median time to tumor progression of vs from 5.6 months before bevacizumab onset, to more than 29.3 months. the need for intravenous injections and long term adverse events (hypertension, proteinuria, hemorrhage) are the main drawbacks. lapatinib seemed promising in a single phase ii trial with a volumetric response observed in 4/17 patients and a hearing response in 4/13, but is not currently used in clinical practice. erlotinib has not been associated with radiographic or hearing responses in a phase ii trial. everolimus has been evaluated in 3 phase ii trials. everolimus did not induced tumor shrinkage, but seems to be able to increase time to tumor progression in selected cases. currently, bevacizumab is the only drug proposed to selected nf2 patients.",2421,apatinib,schwannoma
"vestibular schwannomas (vs) arising sporadically or in patients with neurofibromatosis type 2 (nf2) consistently lack expression of merlin, a tumor suppressor. conventional treatment options include surgery and radiotherapy but there is no validated medical option. recent evidence suggests that merlin deficiency may result in abnormal activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (rtks) and downstream signaling, promoting tumor growth. although smallmolecule rtk inhibitors are widely available for clinical use, no such therapy has been validated in patients with vs. to screen for rtk activation, surgical vs specimens from patients with and without nf2 were analyzed by phosphortk profiling arrays. downstream signaling pathway activation was analyzed by phosphomapk arrays. activated rtks and downstream kinases were validated immunohistochemically in corresponding formalinfixed, paraffinembedded tissues. phosphortk arrays and immunohistochemistry showed consistent overexpression and activation of egfr family receptors and evidence of erk1/2 downstream signaling was observed in all samples analyzed (n = 11). based on the findings, the smallmolecule egfr/erbb2 kinase inhibitor lapatinib was selected for evaluation of target inhibition and treatment efficacy in our in vitro human schwannoma model. egfr/erbb2 targeted therapy with lapatinib inhibited erbb2 phosphorylation and survivin upregulation, as well as downstream erk1/2 and akt activation, resulting in decreased proliferation. we conclude that egfr family receptor activation is a consistent feature of both sporadic and nf2related vs. molecular targeted therapy with lapatinib downregulates survivin and has antiproliferative activity in a preclinical vs model. based on these findings, a clinical trial with lapatinib for the treatment of vs is currently underway. © the author(s) 2010.",2696,apatinib,schwannoma

"loss of the tumor suppressor merlin causes development of the tumors of the nervous system, such as schwannomas, meningiomas, and ependymomas occurring spontaneously or as part of a hereditary disease neurofibromatosis type 2 (nf2). current therapies, (radio) surgery, are not always effective. therefore, there is a need for drug treatments for these tumors. schwannomas are the most frequent of merlindeficient tumors and are hallmark for nf2. using our in vitro human schwannoma model, we demonstrated that merlindeficiency leads to increased proliferation, cellmatrix adhesion, and survival. increased proliferation due to strong activation of extracellularsignalregulated kinase 1/2 (erk1/2) is caused by overexpression/activation of plateletderived growth factor receptorβ (pdgfrβ) and erbb2/3 which we successfully blocked with azd6244, sorafenib, or lapatinib. schwannoma basal proliferation is, however, only partly dependent on pdgfrβ and is completely independent of erbb2/3. moreover, the mechanisms underlying pathological cellmatrix adhesion and survival of schwannoma cells are still not fully understood. here, we demonstrate that insulinlike growth factori receptor (igfir) is strongly overexpressed and activated in human primary schwannoma cells. igfi and ii are overexpressed and released from schwannoma cells. we show that erk1/2 is relevant for igfimediated increase in proliferation and cellmatrix adhesion, cjun nterminal kinases for increased proliferation and akt for survival. we demonstrate new mechanisms involved in increased basal proliferation, cellmatrix adhesion, and survival of schwannoma cells. we identified therapeutic targets igfir and downstream pi3k for treatment of schwannoma and other merlindeficient tumors and show usefulness of small molecule inhibitors in our model. pi3k is relevant for both igfir and previously described pdgfrβ signaling in schwannoma. © 2012 wiley periodicals, inc.",683,sorafenib,schwannoma
"loss of the tumor suppressor merlin is a cause of frequent tumors of the nervous system, such as schwannomas, meningiomas, and ependymomas, which occur spontaneously or as part of neurofibromatosis type 2 (nf2). because there is medical need for drug therapies for these tumors, our aim is to find therapeutic targets. we have studied the pathobiology of schwannomas, because they are the most common merlindeficient tumors and are a model for all merlindeficient tumors. with use of a human schwannoma in vitro model, we previously described strong overexpression/activation of plateletderived growth factor receptorß (pdgfrb) leading to strong, longlasting activation of extracellularsignal regulated kinase (erk1/2) and akt and increased schwannoma growth, which we successfully inhibited using the pdgfr/raf inhibitor sorafenib. however, the benign character of schwannomas may require longterm treatment; thus, drug tolerability is an issue. with the use of western blotting, proliferation assays, viability assays, and a primary human schwannoma cell in vitro model, we tested the pdgfr/ckit inhibitors imatinib (glivec; novartis) and nilotinib (tasigna; novartis). imatinib and nilotinib inhibited pdgfddmediated erk1/2 activation, basal and pdgfddmediated activation of pdgfrß and akt, and schwannoma proliferation. nilotinib is more potent than imatinib, exerting its maximal inhibitory effect at concentrations lower than steadystate trough plasma levels. in addition, nilotinib combined with the mek1/2 inhibitor selumetinib (azd6244) at low concentrations displayed stronger efficiency toward tumor growth inhibition, compared with nilotinib alone. we suggest that therapy with nilotinib or combinational therapy that simultaneously inhibits pdgfr and the downstream raf/mek1/2/erk1/2 pathway could represent an effective treatment for schwannomas and other merlindeficient tumors. © the author(s) 2011.",870,sorafenib,schwannoma

"after nerve injury, schwann cells (scs) dedifferentiate, proliferate, and support axon regrowth. if axons fail to regenerate, denervated scs eventually undergo apoptosis due, in part, to increased expression of the lowaffinity neurotrophin receptor, p75ntr. merlin is the protein product of the nf2 tumor suppressor gene implicated in sc tumorigenesis. here we explore the contribution of merlin to sc responses to nerve injury. we find that merlin becomes phosphorylated (growth permissive) in scs following acute axotomy and following gradual neural degeneration in a deafness model, temporally correlated with increased p75ntr expression. p75ntr levels are elevated in p0schδ39121 transgenic mice that harbor an nf2 mutation in scs relative to wildtype mice before axotomy and remain elevated for a longer period of time following injury. replacement of wildtype, but not phosphomimetic (s518d), merlin isoforms suppresses p75ntr expression in primary human schwannoma cultures which otherwise lack functional merlin. despite elevated levels of p75ntr, sc apoptosis following axotomy is blunted in p0schδ39121 mice relative to wildtype mice suggesting that loss of functional merlin contributes to sc resistance to apoptosis. further, cultured scs from mice with a tamoxifeninducible knockout of nf2 confirm that scs lacking functional merlin are less sensitive to p75ntrmediated cell death. taken together these results point to a model whereby loss of axonal contact following nerve injury results in merlin phosphorylation leading to increased p75ntr expression. further, they demonstrate that merlin facilitates p75ntrmediated apoptosis in scs helping to explain how neoplastic scs that lack functional merlin survive longterm in the absence of axonal contact.",831,tamoxifen,schwannoma
"neurofibromatosis type 2 (nf2) is a genetic syndrome that predisposes individuals to multiple benign tumors of the central and peripheral nervous systems, including vestibular schwannomas. currently, there are no fda approved drug therapies for nf2. loss of function of merlin encoded by the nf2 tumor suppressor gene leads to activation of multiple mitogenic signaling cascades, including plateletderived growth factor receptor (pdgfr) and src in schwann cells. the goal of this study was to determine whether ponatinib, an fdaapproved abl/src inhibitor, reduced proliferation and/or survival of merlindeficient human schwann cells (hsc). merlindeficient hsc had higher levels of phosphorylated pdgfrα/β, and src than merlinexpressing hsc. a similar phosphorylation pattern was observed in phosphoprotein arrays of human vestibular schwannoma samples compared to normal hsc. ponatinib reduced merlindeficient hsc viability in a dosedependent manner by decreasing phosphorylation of pdgfrα/β, akt, p70s6k, mek1/2, erk1/2 and stat3. these changes were associated with decreased cyclin d1 and increased p27kip1levels, leading to a g1 cellcycle arrest as assessed by western blotting and flow cytometry. ponatinib did not modulate abl, src, focal adhesion kinase (fak), or paxillin phosphorylation levels. these results suggest that ponatinib is a potential therapeutic agent for nf2associated schwannomas and warrants further in vivo investigation.",4398,ponatinib,schwannoma
"hypothesis: to investigate the early events in molecular progression toward schwannoma tumorigenesis, we developed an in vitro model of human schwann cell tumorigenesis by merlin knockdown. background: neurofibromatosis 2 (nf2)related and sporadic vestibular schwannoma (vs) exhibit loss of functional merlin (schwannomin). after loss of merlin expression in the schwann cell, the initial steps toward vs tumorigenesis are unknown. merlin, a putative tumor suppressor protein, interacts with many cellular proteins, regulating their function. among these are receptor tyrosine kinases, including the epidermal growth factor receptor family b (erbb) family receptors epidermal growth factor receptor and erbb2. functional merlin interacts with and internalizes these growth factor receptors, silencing their proliferation and survival signaling. deregulation of cd44, the cell adhesion/signaling molecule and cancer stem cell marker, has also been implicated in vs tumorigenesis. methods: merlin knockdown was performed using small interfering rna transfection into human schwann cell primary cultures. knockdown was confirmed by realtime quantitative pcr, immunofluorescence, and western analysis. expression profiles of erbb, merlin, and the stem cell markers nestin and cd44 were examined in knockdowns. proliferation rate was assessed with bromodeoxyuridine incorporation, and radiation sensitivity was assessed using the annexin assay in knockdowns versus controls. results: merlin knockdowns demonstrated increased proliferation rate, upregulation of epidermal growth factor receptor, erbb2, and erbb3, cd44, and nestin. shortterm merlin depletion had no effect on γ irradiation sensitivity compared with controls. conclusion: merlin depletion results in deregulation of erbb receptor signaling, promotes a dedifferentiated state, and increases schwann cell proliferation, suggesting critical steps toward schwannoma tumorigenesis. © 2010, otology & neurotology, inc.",2377,uridine,schwannoma

"neurofibromatosis type ii (nf2) is a disease that needs new solutions. vestibular schwannoma (vs) growth causes progressive hearing loss, and the standard treatment, including surgery and radiotherapy, can further damage the nerve. there is an urgent need to identify an adjunct therapy that, by enhancing the efficacy of radiation, can help lower the radiation dose and preserve hearing. the mechanisms underlying deafness in nf2 are still unclear. one of the major limitations in studying tumorinduced hearing loss is the lack of mouse models that allow hearing testing. here, we developed a cerebellopontine angle (cpa) schwannoma model that faithfully recapitulates the tumorinduced hearing loss. using this model, we discovered that cmet blockade by crizotinib (crz) enhanced schwannoma radiosensitivity by enhancing dna damage, and crz treatment combined with lowdose radiation was as effective as highdose radiation. crz treatment had no adverse effect on hearing; however, it did not affect tumorinduced hearing loss, presumably because cmet blockade did not change tumor hepatocyte growth factor (hgf) levels. this cmet gene knockdown study independently confirmed the role of the cmet pathway in mediating the effect of crz. furthermore, we evaluated the translational potential of cmet blockade in human schwannomas. we found that human nf2associated and sporadic vss showed significantly elevated hgf expression and cmet activation compared with normal nerves, which correlated with tumor growth and cyst formation. using organoid brain slice culture, cmet blockade inhibited the growth of patientderived schwannomas. our findings provide the rationale and necessary data for the clinical translation of combined cmet blockade with radiation therapy in patients with nf2.",1533,crizotinib,schwannoma

"loss of the tumor suppressor merlin is a cause of frequent tumors of the nervous system, such as schwannomas, meningiomas, and ependymomas, which occur spontaneously or as part of neurofibromatosis type 2 (nf2). because there is medical need for drug therapies for these tumors, our aim is to find therapeutic targets. we have studied the pathobiology of schwannomas, because they are the most common merlindeficient tumors and are a model for all merlindeficient tumors. with use of a human schwannoma in vitro model, we previously described strong overexpression/activation of plateletderived growth factor receptorß (pdgfrb) leading to strong, longlasting activation of extracellularsignal regulated kinase (erk1/2) and akt and increased schwannoma growth, which we successfully inhibited using the pdgfr/raf inhibitor sorafenib. however, the benign character of schwannomas may require longterm treatment; thus, drug tolerability is an issue. with the use of western blotting, proliferation assays, viability assays, and a primary human schwannoma cell in vitro model, we tested the pdgfr/ckit inhibitors imatinib (glivec; novartis) and nilotinib (tasigna; novartis). imatinib and nilotinib inhibited pdgfddmediated erk1/2 activation, basal and pdgfddmediated activation of pdgfrß and akt, and schwannoma proliferation. nilotinib is more potent than imatinib, exerting its maximal inhibitory effect at concentrations lower than steadystate trough plasma levels. in addition, nilotinib combined with the mek1/2 inhibitor selumetinib (azd6244) at low concentrations displayed stronger efficiency toward tumor growth inhibition, compared with nilotinib alone. we suggest that therapy with nilotinib or combinational therapy that simultaneously inhibits pdgfr and the downstream raf/mek1/2/erk1/2 pathway could represent an effective treatment for schwannomas and other merlindeficient tumors. © the author(s) 2011.",870,imatinib,schwannoma
"neurofibromatosis type 2 ( nf2; mim # 101000) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the development of vestibular schwannomas (vss); schwannomas of other cranial, spinal, and cutaneous nerves; cranial and spinal meningiomas or other central nervous system tumors (eg, ependymomas and astrocytomas) or both. additional features include eye (eg, early onset cataracts, optic nerve sheath meningiomas, retinal or pigment epithelial hamartomas or both, and epithelial retinal membranes) and skin abnormalities (eg, flat dermal [nf2 plaques] or spherical subcutaneous nodular schwannomas or both, and few, atypical caféaulait spots). clinically, children with nf2 fall into 2 main groups: (1) congenital nf2 with bilateral vss detected as early as the first days to months of life, which can be stable or asymptomatic for 12 decades and suddenly progress; and (2) severe prepubertal (wishart type) nf2 with multiple (and rapidly progressive) central nervous system tumors otherthanvs, which usually presents first, years before vss, both associated with more marked skin and eye involvement (vs the classical mild adult [gardner type] nf2, with bilateral vss presenting in young adulthood, sometimes as the only disease feature). individuals manifesting unilateral vs associated with ipsilateral meningiomas or multiple schwannomas localized to a part of the peripheral nervous system have mosaic or segmental nf2; individuals developing multiple nonvs, nonintradermal cranial, spinal, and peripheral schwannomas (histologically proven) have schwannomatosis ( swnts). nf2 is caused by mutations in the nf2 gene at chromosome 22q12.1, which encodes for a protein called merlin or schwannomin, most similar to the exrinreadixinmoesin proteins; mosaic or segmental nf2 is because of mosaic phenomena for the nf2 gene, whereas swnts is caused by germline and possibly mosaic mutations either in the smarcb1 gene (. swnts1; mim # 162091) or the lztr1 gene (swnts2; mim # 615670), both falling within the 22q region. data driven from in vitro and animal studies on the merlin pathway allowed biologically targeted treatment strategies (employing lapatinib, erlotinib, everolimus, picropodophyllin, osu.03012, imatinib, sorafenib, and bevacizumab) aimed at multiple tumor shrinkage or regression or both and tumor arrest of progression with functional improvement.",1549,imatinib,schwannoma

"neurofibromatosis 2 (nf2) is a rare tumor suppressor syndrome that manifests with multiple schwannomas and meningiomas. there are no effective drug therapies for these benign tumors and conventional therapies have limited efficacy. various model systems have been created and several drug targets have been implicated in nf2driven tumorigenesis based on known effects of the absence of merlin, the product of the nf2 gene. we tested priority compounds based on known biology with traditional doseconcentration studies in meningioma and schwann cell systems. concurrently, we studied functional kinome and gene expression in these cells pre and posttreatment to determine merlin deficient molecular phenotypes. cell viability results showed that three agents (gsk2126458, panobinostat, cudc907) had the greatest activity across schwannoma and meningioma cell systems, but merlin status did not significantly influence response. in vivo, drug effect was tumor specific with meningioma, but not schwannoma, showing response to gsk2126458 and panobinostat. in culture, changes in both the transcriptome and kinome in response to treatment clustered predominantly based on tumor type. however, there were differences in both gene expression and functional kinome at baseline between meningioma and schwannoma cell systems that may form the basis for future selective therapies. this work has created an openly accessible resource (www.synapse.org/synodosnf2) of fully characterized isogenic schwannoma and meningioma cell systems as well as a rich data source of kinome and transcriptome data from these assay systems before and after treatment that enables single and combination drug discovery based on molecular phenotype.",355,cudc907,schwannoma
"neurofibromatosis type 2 (nf2) is a nervous system tumor disorder caused by inactivation of the merlin tumor suppressor encoded by the nf2 gene. bilateral vestibular schwannomas are a diagnostic hallmark of nf2. mainstream treatment options for nf2associated tumors have been limited to surgery and radiotherapy; however, offlabel uses of targeted molecular therapies are becoming increasingly common. here, we investigated drugs targeting two kinases activated in nf2associated schwannomas, cmet and src. we demonstrated that merlindeficient mouse schwann cells (mdmsc) treated with the cmet inhibitor, cabozantinib, or the src kinase inhibitors, dasatinib and saracatinib, underwent a g1 cellcycle arrest. however, when mdmscs were treated with a combination of cabozantinib and saracatinib, they exhibited caspasedependent apoptosis. the combination therapy also significantly reduced growth of mdmscs in an orthotopic allograft mouse model by greater than 80% of vehicle. moreover, human vestibular schwannoma cells with nf2 mutations had a 40% decrease in cell viability when treated with cabozantinib and saracatinib together compared with the vehicle control. this study demonstrates that simultaneous inhibition of cmet and src signaling in mdmscs triggers apoptosis and reveals vulnerable pathways that could be exploited to develop nf2 therapies.",1370,cabozantinib,schwannoma
"opinion statement: neurofibromatosis type 1 (nf1) and type 2 (nf2) are genetically and medically distinct neurocutaneous disorders that are both associated with tumors affecting the central and peripheral nervous systems. nf1 has a frequency of 1 in 3,000, compared with 1 in 30,000 for nf2. careful surveillance is important for both conditions, to allow early identification and treatment of complications. the most common and important problems in nf1 are cognitive impairment, optic pathway gliomas, plexiform neurofibromas, and orthopaedic issues. early intervention and tailored educational programs are indicated for learning difficulties. attention deficit hyperactivity disorder may be amenable to treatment with stimulant medication. a clinical trial is under way to evaluate lovastatin in the treatment of cognitive problems in children with nf1. chemotherapy with vincristine and carboplatin is the current standard of care for symptomatic optic pathway gliomas, but new agents with improved efficacy are needed. plexiform neurofibromas may be treated with surgery, but often recur. to date, no medical therapy has proven effective in limiting plexiform neurofibroma growth, but several candidate medications are under consideration in clinical trials. malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors may arise in preexisting plexiform neurofibromas, so changes in tumor growth or an increase in pain or focal neurologic deficit should prompt further investigation and early treatment with wide surgical resection, with or without adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy. specialist surgical intervention may be needed for scoliosis and tibial pseudoarthrosis. in nf2, surgical treatment remains a cornerstone of management for symptomatic progressive vestibular schwannomas, meningiomas, and spinal tumors. vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors show promise for the treatment of vestibular schwannomas, with the aim of delaying surgery, and other targeted molecular therapies are becoming available as investigational options. hearing aids and brainstem and cochlear implants have a role in optimizing functional hearing in some patients. specialist ophthalmology input should be arranged to monitor for ophthalmologic complications. a coordinated effort is needed to enroll nf1 and nf2 patients in international multicenter clinical trials of promising new pharmacologic agents. genetic testing is useful for prenatal diagnosis and may be important in understanding individual responses to novel medical therapies in the future. effective transition to adult services is important, considering the likelihood of further complications in the adult years. © 2011 springer science+business media, llc.",4591,vincristine,schwannoma
"background:both the number and size of tumours in nf1 patients increase in response to the rise in steroid hormones seen at puberty and during pregnancy. the size of tumours decreases after delivery, suggesting that hormonetargeting therapy might provide a viable new nf1 treatment approach. our earlier studies demonstrated that human nf1 tumour cell lines either went through apoptosis or ceased growth in the presence of 2methoxyoestradiol (2me2), a naturally occurring anticancer metabolite of 17β estradiol. previous reports of treatment with sulfamoylated steroidal and nonsteroidal derivatives of 2me2 showed promising reductions in tumour burden in hormoneresponsive cancers other than nf1. here we present the first studies indicating that 2me2 derivatives could also provide an avenue for treating nf1, for which few treatment options are available.methods:stx3451, (2(3bromo4,5dimethoxybenzyl)7methoxy6sulfamoyloxy1,2,3,4tetrahydroisoquinoline), a nonsteroidal sulphamate analogue of 2me2, was tested in dosedependent studies of malignant and benign nf1 human tumour cell lines and cell lines with variable controlled neurofibromin expression. the mechanisms of action of stx3451 were also analysed.results:we found that stx3451induced apoptosis in human malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour (mpnst) cell lines, even in the presence of elevated oestrogen and progesterone. it inhibits both pi3 kinase and mtor signalling pathways. it disrupts actin and microtubulebased cytoskeletal structures in cell lines derived from human mpnsts and in cells derived from benign plexiform neurofibromas. stx3451 selectively kills mpnstderived cells, but also halts growth of other tumourderived nf1 cell lines.conclusion:stx3451 provides a new approach for inducing cell death and lowering tumour burden in nf1 and other hormoneresponsive cancers with limited treatment options.",1232,estradiol,pNF
"objective to assess the relationship between pubertal progression and change in plexiform neurofibroma (pn) burden over time in pediatric and young adult patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 and pns. study design analyses accounted for sex, age, race, and chemotherapy. fortyone patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (15 female and 26 male patients) were studied at the national institutes of health. tanner stage, testosterone, progesterone, estradiol, insulinlike growth factor 1, luteinizing hormone, and folliclestimulating hormone were assessed. tumor volume was measured using magnetic resonance imaging and lesion detection software developed locally. patients were divided into 2 groups based on whether they were actively progressing through puberty (n = 16) or were peripubertal (n = 25) and were followed for an average of 20 months. tumor growth rates in the puberty and peripubertal group were analyzed for a subset of patients. results there was no statistically significant difference in tumor burden change over time (cm 2/kg per month) between the pubertal and peripubertal groups (0.16 ± 0.34 vs 0.03 ± 1.8, p =.31) and in the pn growth rates before and during puberty (p =.90). change in tumor volume/patient weight/time did not correlate with testosterone change/time in males or estradiol change/time in females. conclusion these findings support that hormonal changes of puberty do not accelerate pn growth. additional longterm followup of patients is necessary to further characterize the interaction between puberty and tumor growth. © 2014 mosby inc.",1361,estradiol,pNF
"few therapeutic options are available for malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (mpnsts), the most common malignancy associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (nf1). guided by clinical observations suggesting that some nf1associated nerve sheath tumors are hormonally responsive, we hypothesized that the selective estrogen receptor (er) modulator tamoxifen would inhibit mpnst tumorigenesis in vitro and in vivo. to test this hypothesis, we examined tamoxifen effects on mpnst cell proliferation and survival, mpnst xenograft growth, and the mechanism by which tamoxifen impeded these processes. we found that 15 μm 4hydroxytamoxifen induced mpnst cell death, whereas 0.010.1 μm 4hydroxytamoxifen inhibited mitogenesis. dermal and plexiform neurofibromas, mpnsts, and mpnst cell lines expressed erβ and gproteincoupled er1 (gper); mpnsts also expressed estrogen biosynthetic enzymes. however, mpnst cells did not secrete 17βestradiol, exogenous 17βestradiol did not stimulate mitogenesis or rescue 4hydroxytamoxifen effects on mpnst cells, and the steroidal antiestrogen ici182,780 did not mimic tamoxifen effects on mpnst cells. further, ablation of erb and gper had no effect on mpnst proliferation, survival, or tamoxifen sensitivity, indicating that tamoxifen acts via an erindependent mechanism. consistent with this hypothesis, inhibitors of calmodulin (trifluoperazine, w7), another known tamoxifen target, recapitulated 4hydroxytamoxifen effects on mpnst cells. tamoxifen was also effective in vivo, demonstrating potent antitumor activity in mice orthotopically xenografted with human mpnst cells. we conclude that 4hydroxytamoxifen inhibits mpnst cell proliferation and survival via an erindependent mechanism. the in vivo effectiveness of tamoxifen provides a rationale for clinical trials in cases of mpnsts. © the author(s) 2010.",3454,estradiol,pNF

"neurofibromatosis type 1 (nf1) is one of the most common neurocutaneous disorders. some nf1 patients develop benign large plexiform neurofibroma(s) at birth, which can then transform into a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (mpnst). there is no curative treatment for this rapidly progressive and easily metastatic neurofibrosarcoma. photodynamic therapy (pdt) has been developed as an anticancer treatment, and 5aminolevulinic (ala) mediated pdt (alapdt) has been used to treat cutaneous skin and oral neoplasms. doxycycline, a tetracycline derivative, can substantially reduce the tumor burden in human and animal models, in addition to its antimicrobial effects. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect and to investigate the mechanism of action of combined doxycycline and alapdt treatment of mpnst cells. an 3(4,5dimethylthiazol2yl)2,5diphenyltetrazolium bromide (mtt) assay showed that the combination of alapdt and doxycycline significantly reduce mpnst survival rate, compared to cells treated with each therapy alone. isobologram analysis showed that the combined treatment had a synergistic effect. the increased cytotoxic activity could be seen by an increase in cellular protoporphyrin ix (ppix) accumulation. furthermore, we found that the higher retention of ppix was mainly due to increasing ala uptake, rather than activity changes of the enzymes porphobilinogen deaminase and ferrochelatase. the combined treatment inhibited tumor growth in different tumor cell lines, but not in normal human schwann cells or fibroblasts. similarly, a synergistic interaction was also found in cells treated with alapdt combined with minocycline, but not tetracycline. in summary, doxycycline can potentiate the effect of alapdt to kill tumor cells. this increased potency allows for a dose reduction of doxycycline and photodynamic radiation, reducing the occurrence of toxic side effects in vivo.",4724,tetracycline,pNF

"plexiform neurofibromas (pns), which may be present at birth in up to half of children with type 1 neurofibromatosis (nf1), can cause serious loss of function, such as quadriparesis, and can undergo malignant transformation. surgery is the first line treatment although the invasive nature of these tumors often prevents complete resection. recent clinical trials have shown promising success for some drugs, notably selumetinib, an inhibitor of map kinase kinase (mek). we have developed threedimensional (3d) cell culture models of immortalized cells from nf1 pns and of control schwann cells (scs) that we believe mimic more closely the in vivo condition than conventional twodimensional (2d) cell culture. our goal is to facilitate preclinical identification of potential targeted therapeutics for these tumors. three drugs, selumetinib (a mek inhibitor), picropodophyllin (an igf1r inhibitor) and ldn193189 (a bmp2 inhibitor) were tested with doseresponse design in both 2d and 3d cultures for their abilities to block net cell growth. cell lines grown in 3d conditions showed varying degrees of resistance to the inhibitory actions of all three drugs. for example, control scs became resistant to growth inhibition by selumetinib in 3d culture. ldn193189 was the most effective drug in 3d cultures, with only slightly reduced potency compared to the 2d cultures. characterization of these models also demonstrated increased proteolysis of collagen iv in the matrix by the pn driver cells as compared to wildtype scs. the proteolytic capacity of the pn cells in the model may be a clinically significant property that can be used for testing the ability of drugs to inhibit their invasive phenotype.",1952,selumetinib,pNF

"background effective medical therapies are lacking for the treatment of neurofibromatosis type 1 related plexiform neurofibromas, which are characterized by elevated rasmitogenactivated protein kinase (mapk) signaling. methods we conducted a phase 1 trial of selumetinib (azd6244 or arry142886), an oral selective inhibitor of mapk kinase (mek) 1 and 2, in children who had neurofibromatosis type 1 and inoperable plexiform neurofibromas to determine the maximum tolerated dose and to evaluate plasma pharmacokinetics. selumetinib was administered twice daily at a dose of 20 to 30 mg per square meter of bodysurface area on a continuous dosing schedule (in 28day cycles). we also tested selumetinib using a mouse model of neurofibromatosis type 1related neurofibroma. response to treatment (i.e., an increase or decrease from baseline in the volume of plexiform neurofibromas) was monitored by using volumetric magnetic resonance imaging analysis to measure the change in size of the plexiform neurofibroma. results a total of 24 children (median age, 10.9 years; range, 3.0 to 18.5) with a median tumor volume of 1205 ml (range, 29 to 8744) received selumetinib. patients were able to receive selumetinib on a longterm basis; the median number of cycles was 30 (range, 6 to 56). the maximum tolerated dose was 25 mg per square meter (approximately 60% of the recommended adult dose). the most common toxic effects associated with selumetinib included acneiform rash, gastrointestinal effects, and asymptomatic creatine kinase elevation. the results of pharmacokinetic evaluations of selumetinib among the children in this trial were similar to those published for adults. treatment with selumetinib resulted in confirmed partial responses (tumor volume decreases from baseline of ≥20%) in 17 of the 24 children (71%) and decreases from baseline in neurofibroma volume in 12 of 18 mice (67%). disease progression (tumor volume increase from baseline of ≥20%) has not been observed to date. anecdotal evidence of decreases in tumorrelated pain, disfigurement, and functional impairment was observed. conclusions our earlyphase data suggested that children with neurofibromatosis type 1 and inoperable plexiform neurofibromas benefited from longterm doseadjusted treatment with selumetinib without having excess toxic effects.",4824,selumetinib,pNF
"background: neurofibromatosis type 1 (nf1) is one of the most common hereditary neurocutaneous disorders. the malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (mpnst), transformed from nf1 related plexiform neurofibroma, is a rapidly growing and highly invasive tumor. no effective chemotherapeutic agent is currently available. calebina is a derivative from turmeric curcuma longa. given the antiinflammatory and anticancer potentials of curcumin, whether calebina also had the tumoricidal effect upon mpnst cells is still elusive. purpose: to determine whether calebina has the potential for antimpnst effect. methods: the mtt and facs analysis of normal schwann (hsc) and mpnst cells have been employed to determine the tumoricidal effect of calebina. the expression of the signal pathway molecules was assessed by western blotting. the chip with quantitative pcr assay was performed to quantify the promoter dna binding to acetylated histone 3 (acetyl h3). the enzyme activities of histone acetyltransferase (hat) and deacetylase (hdac) have been evaluated by commercial kits. the measurements of tumor size of the xenograft mouse model were also performed. results: calebina inhibited the proliferation of mpnst and primary neurofibroma cells in a dosedependent manner. the flow cytometry analysis of the mpnst cells after treatment of 25 μm of calebina demonstrated an increase of population in the g0/g1 phase but decrease in g2/m phase. before treatment, the expression of axl, tyro3, and acetyl h3 was significantly higher in mpnst cells when compared to hsc. the expression of phosphorylatedakt, erk1/2, survivin, htert, and acetyl h3 proteins were reduced after treatment. the chip assay shows the promoter dna copies of survivin (bric5) and htert genes are significantly reduced posttreatment. the enzyme activity of hat was significantly reduced, but not that of hdac. two hat inhibitors, epigallocatechin3gallate (egcg) and anacardic acid (aa) have also demonstrated a significant inhibitory effect on mpnst cells. finally, the measurements of tumor size showed a significant reduction of the xenograft tumors after treatment of calebina. conclusion: both in vitro and in vivo studies showed calebina could inhibit the proliferation of mpnst with suppression of survivin and htert. the reduced expression of these two factors might be through the epigenetic histone modification resulting from the decreased activity of hat.",4154,curcumin,pNF
"neurofibromas are the hallmark lesions in neurofibromatosis 1 (nf1); these tumors are classified as cutaneous, subcutaneous and plexiform. in contrast to cutaneous and subcutaneous neurofibromas, plexiform neurofibromas can grow quickly and progress to malignancy. curcumin, a turmericderived polyphenol, has been shown to interact with several molecular targets implicated in carcinogenesis. here, we describe the impact of different dietary patterns, namely mediterranean diet (meddiet) compared to the western diet (wesdiet), both with or without curcumin, on nf1 patients’ health. after six months, patients adopting a traditional meddiet enriched with 1200 mg curcumin per day (meddietcurcumin) presented a significant reduction in the number and volume of cutaneous neurofibromas; these results were confirmed in subsequent evaluations. notably, in one patient, a large cranial plexiform neurofibroma exhibited a reduction in volume (28%) confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging. conversely, neither unenriched meddiet nor wesdiet enriched with curcumin exhibited any significant positive effect. we hypothesize that the combination of a polyphenolrich mediterranean diet and curcumin was responsible for the beneficial effect observed on nf1. this is, to the best of our knowledge, the first experience with curcumin supplementation in nf1 patients. our report suggests that an integrated nutritional approach may effectively aid in the management of nf1.",4858,curcumin,pNF
"neurofibromatosis type i (nf1) is an autosomal disorder that affects neural crestderived tissues, leading to a wide spectrum of clinical presentations. patients commonly present with plexiform neurofibromas, benign but debilitating growths that can transform into malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (mpnst), a main cause of mortality. currently, surgery is the primary course of treatment for mpnst, but with the limitation that these tumors are highly invasive. radiotherapy is another treatment option, but is undesirable because it can induce additional mutations. patients with mpnst may also receive doxorubicin as therapy, but this dnaintercalating agent has relatively low tumor specificity and limited efficacy. in this study, we exploited a robust genetically engineered mouse model of mpnst that recapitulates human nf1associated mpnst to identify a novel small chemical compound that inhibits tumor cell growth. compound 21 (cpd21) inhibits growth of all available in vitro models of mpnst and human mpnst cell lines, while remaining nontoxic to normally dividing schwann cells or mouse embryonic fibroblasts. we show that this compound delays the cell cycle and leads to cellular apoptosis. moreover, cpd21 can reduce mpnst burden in a mouse allograft model, underscoring the compound's potential as a novel chemotherapeutic agent. © 2013 american association for cancer research.",429,doxorubicin,pNF
"since the biallelic inactivation of both neurofibromin 1 (nf1) gene alleles (nf1/) in schwann cells (scs) is common in both benign plexiform neurofibromas (pns) and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (mpnsts) in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (nf1), other genetic alterations in scs may be required for tumor progression of pns to mpnsts. we found that the antiapoptotic bclxl protein is upregulated in mpnst tissues compared to pn tissues from patients with nf1 by immunohistological staining. in addition, we investigated whether bclxl is upregulated in scs derived from mpnsts and found a significantly higher bclxl expression level in snf96.2 mpnstderived scs compared to normal human scs (hscs). we also discovered that the increased bclxl expression caused an increase in drug resistance to doxorubicin in mpnstderived scs. manipulation of nf1 gene expression levels by treatment with small interfering rna (sirna) and overexpression of the neurofibromin gaprelated domain (nf1grd) demonstrated that upregulated bclxl expression in mpnstderived scs was caused by nf1 deficiency. treatment with the erk1/2 inhibitor, pd98059, resulted in a slight increase in bclxl levels in neurofibromindepleted normal hscs, indicating that bclxl upregulation in mpnstderived scs is mediated by activated erk1/2, which is a ras downstream protein regulated by neurofibromin. as the reduction of bclxl expression restored sensitivity to doxorubicininduced apoptosis in snf96.2 cells, we examined the effect of the small molecule bclxl inhibitor abt737 on snf96.2 cells. a very low dose of abt737 combined with doxorubicin synergistically enhanced sensitivity to doxorubicininduced apoptosis in snf96.2 cells, suggesting that abt737 and doxorubicin may be a good combination to effectively treat nf1associated mpnsts with minimal sideeffects. collectively, our results suggest that upregulation of bclxl in mpnstderived scs may be caused by the nf1 deficiencymediated elevation in ras/mapk signaling and may provide a new potential chemotherapeutic target in patients with nf1 and mpnsts.",484,doxorubicin,pNF
"malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (mpnst) are rare, highly aggressive sarcomas that can occur spontaneously or from preexisting plexiform neurofibromas in neurofibromatosis type1 (nf1) patients. mpnsts have high local recurrence rates, metastasize easily, are generally resistant to therapeutic intervention and frequently fatal for the patient. novel targeted therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. standard treatment for patients presenting with advanced disease is doxorubicin based chemotherapy which inhibits the actions of the enzyme topoisomerase iiα (top2a). recent molecular studies using murine models and cell lines identified the bromodomain containing protein 4 (brd4) and enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (ezh2) as novel targets for mpnst treatment. we investigated the expression and potential use of brd4, ezh2 and top2a as therapeutic targets in human nf1derived mpnsts. the transcript levels of brd4, ezh2 and top2a were determined in paired formalinfixed paraffinembedded (ffpe) neurofibroma/mpnst samples derived from the same nf1 patient and in a set of plexiform neurofibromas, atypical neurofibromas and mpnst. we further examined the effect on cell viability of genetic or pharmacological inhibition of brd4, ezh2 and top2a in an mpnst cell line panel. our results indicated that in mpnst samples brd4 mrna levels were not upregulated and that mpnst cell lines were relatively insensitive to the bromodomain inhibitor jq1. we corroborated that ezh2 mrna expression is increased in mpnst but failed to confirm its reported pivotal role in mpnst pathogenesis as ezh2 knockdown by sirna did not interfere with cellular proliferation and viability. finally, the relation between top2a levels and sensitivity for doxorubicin was examined, confirming reports that top2a mrna levels were overexpressed in mpnst and showing that mpnst cell lines exhibited relatively high top2a protein levels and sensitivity to doxorubicin. we tentatively conclude that the potential for effective therapeutic intervention in mpnst by targeting brd4, ezh2 and top2a individually, may be limited. clinical studies are necessary to ultimately prove the relevance of brd4 and ezh2 inhibition as novel therapeutic strategies for mpnst.",2048,doxorubicin,pNF
"the neurofibroma, a common feature of neurofibromatosis type 1 (nf1), is a benign peripheral nerve sheath tumor that contains predominantly schwann cells (sc). there are reports that neurofibroma growth may be affected by hormonal changes, particularly in puberty and pregnancy, suggesting an influence by steroid hormones. this study examined the effects of estrogen and progesterone on proliferation and apoptosis in a panel of nf1 tumor xenografts. scenriched cultures derived from three human nf1 tumor types (dermal neurofibroma, plexiform neurofibroma and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (mpnst)) were xenografted in sciatic nerves of ovariectomized scid/nf1/+ mice. at the same time, mice were implanted with timerelease pellets for systemic delivery of progesterone, estrogen or placebo. proliferation and apoptosis by the xenografted sc were examined two months after implantation, by ki67 immunolabeling and tunel. estrogen was found to increase the growth of all three mpnst xenografts. progesterone was associated with increased growth in two of the three mpnsts, yet decreased growth of the other. of the four dermal neurofibroma xenografts tested, estrogen caused a statistically significant growth increase in one and progesterone did in another. of the four plexiform neurofibroma sc xenografts, estrogen and progesterone significantly decreased growth in one of the xenografts, but not the other three. no relationship of patient age or gender to steroid response was observed. these findings indicate that human nf1 schwann cells derived from some tumors show increased proliferation or decreased apoptosis in response to particular steroid hormones in a mouse xenograft model. this suggests that antiestrogen or antiprogesterone therapies may be worth considering for specific nf1 neurofibromas and mpnsts. © 2010 landes bioscience.",337,progesterone,pNF

"background: sorafenib targets multiple pathways thought to be crucial in growth of plexiform neurofibroma (pn) in children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (nf1). sorafenib has been tolerated with manageable toxicities in adults and children with refractory cancer. we conducted a separate study in this population. monitoring longterm toxicities such as effects on growth and obtaining additional pharmacokinetic data were of importance due to the young age and long duration of therapy seen in previous phase i trials in children with nf1. procedure: children ≥3 and ≤18yearold with nf1 and inoperable pn were eligible. sorafenib was administered orally twice daily for consecutive 28day cycles. maximum tolerated dose (mtd) was determined from toxicities observed during the first three cycles. results: nine children enrolled, median age 8 (612) years. at the starting 115mg/m2/dose (n=5), two experienced doselimiting grade 3 pain in their pn. at the deescalated 80mg/m2/dose (n=4), approximately 40% of the pediatric solid tumor mtd, two had doselimiting toxicity (grade 3 rash and grade 4 mood alteration), exceeding the mtd. at 80mg/m2/dose, the median auc012hours at steadystate was 39.5μghours/ml. toxicities appeared to correspond with decreases in quality of life (qol). no tumor shrinkage was observed. conclusions: children with nf1 and pn did not tolerate sorafenib at doses substantially lower than the mtd in children and adults with malignant solid tumors. future trials with targeted agents for children with nf1 may require a more conservative starting dose and separate definitions of dose limiting toxicities (dlt) than children with cancer. © 2012 wiley periodicals, inc.",1358,sorafenib,pNF

"objective to assess the relationship between pubertal progression and change in plexiform neurofibroma (pn) burden over time in pediatric and young adult patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 and pns. study design analyses accounted for sex, age, race, and chemotherapy. fortyone patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (15 female and 26 male patients) were studied at the national institutes of health. tanner stage, testosterone, progesterone, estradiol, insulinlike growth factor 1, luteinizing hormone, and folliclestimulating hormone were assessed. tumor volume was measured using magnetic resonance imaging and lesion detection software developed locally. patients were divided into 2 groups based on whether they were actively progressing through puberty (n = 16) or were peripubertal (n = 25) and were followed for an average of 20 months. tumor growth rates in the puberty and peripubertal group were analyzed for a subset of patients. results there was no statistically significant difference in tumor burden change over time (cm 2/kg per month) between the pubertal and peripubertal groups (0.16 ± 0.34 vs 0.03 ± 1.8, p =.31) and in the pn growth rates before and during puberty (p =.90). change in tumor volume/patient weight/time did not correlate with testosterone change/time in males or estradiol change/time in females. conclusion these findings support that hormonal changes of puberty do not accelerate pn growth. additional longterm followup of patients is necessary to further characterize the interaction between puberty and tumor growth. © 2014 mosby inc.",1361,testosterone,pNF
"since the biallelic inactivation of both neurofibromin 1 (nf1) gene alleles (nf1/) in schwann cells (scs) is common in both benign plexiform neurofibromas (pns) and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (mpnsts) in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (nf1), other genetic alterations in scs may be required for tumor progression of pns to mpnsts. we found that the antiapoptotic bclxl protein is upregulated in mpnst tissues compared to pn tissues from patients with nf1 by immunohistological staining. in addition, we investigated whether bclxl is upregulated in scs derived from mpnsts and found a significantly higher bclxl expression level in snf96.2 mpnstderived scs compared to normal human scs (hscs). we also discovered that the increased bclxl expression caused an increase in drug resistance to doxorubicin in mpnstderived scs. manipulation of nf1 gene expression levels by treatment with small interfering rna (sirna) and overexpression of the neurofibromin gaprelated domain (nf1grd) demonstrated that upregulated bclxl expression in mpnstderived scs was caused by nf1 deficiency. treatment with the erk1/2 inhibitor, pd98059, resulted in a slight increase in bclxl levels in neurofibromindepleted normal hscs, indicating that bclxl upregulation in mpnstderived scs is mediated by activated erk1/2, which is a ras downstream protein regulated by neurofibromin. as the reduction of bclxl expression restored sensitivity to doxorubicininduced apoptosis in snf96.2 cells, we examined the effect of the small molecule bclxl inhibitor abt737 on snf96.2 cells. a very low dose of abt737 combined with doxorubicin synergistically enhanced sensitivity to doxorubicininduced apoptosis in snf96.2 cells, suggesting that abt737 and doxorubicin may be a good combination to effectively treat nf1associated mpnsts with minimal sideeffects. collectively, our results suggest that upregulation of bclxl in mpnstderived scs may be caused by the nf1 deficiencymediated elevation in ras/mapk signaling and may provide a new potential chemotherapeutic target in patients with nf1 and mpnsts.",484,pd98059,pNF

"purpose: plexiform neurofibromas (pnf) are pathognomonic nerve and soft tissue tumors of neurofibromatosis type i (nf1), which are highly resistant to conventional chemotherapy and associated with significant morbidity/mortality. disruption of aberrant scf/ckit signaling emanating from the pnf microenvironment induced the first ever objective therapeutic responses in a recent phase 2 trial. sunitinib malate is a potent, highly selective rtk inhibitor with activity against ckit, pdgfr, and vegfr, which have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of these lesions. here, we evaluate the efficacy of sunitinib malate in a preclinical krox20;nf1flox/− pnf murine model. experimental design: proliferation, βhexosaminidase release (degranulation), and erk1/2 phosphorylation were assessed in sunitinib treated nf1+/− mast cells and fibroblasts, respectively. krox20;nf1flox/ mice with established pnf were treated sunitinib or pbsvehicle control for a duration of 12 weeks. pnf metabolic activity was monitored by serial [18f]dgpet/ct imaging. results: sunitinib suppressed multiple in vitro gaininfunctions of nf1+/− mast cells and fibroblasts and attenuated erk1/2 phosphorylation. sunitinib treated krox20;nf1flox/− mice exhibited significant reductions in pnf size, tumor number, and fdg uptake compared to control mice. histopathology revealed reduced tumor cellularity and infiltrating mast cells, markedly diminished collagen deposition, and increased cellular apoptosis in sunitinib treated pnf. conclusions: collectively, these results demonstrate the efficacy of sunitinib in reducing tumor burden in krox20;nf1flox/− mice. these preclinical findings demonstrate the utility of inhibiting multiple rtks in pnf and provide insights into the design of future clinical trials. pediatr blood cancer © 2015 wiley periodicals, inc.",4422,sunitinib,pNF

"opinion statement: neurofibromatosis type 1 (nf1) and type 2 (nf2) are genetically and medically distinct neurocutaneous disorders that are both associated with tumors affecting the central and peripheral nervous systems. nf1 has a frequency of 1 in 3,000, compared with 1 in 30,000 for nf2. careful surveillance is important for both conditions, to allow early identification and treatment of complications. the most common and important problems in nf1 are cognitive impairment, optic pathway gliomas, plexiform neurofibromas, and orthopaedic issues. early intervention and tailored educational programs are indicated for learning difficulties. attention deficit hyperactivity disorder may be amenable to treatment with stimulant medication. a clinical trial is under way to evaluate lovastatin in the treatment of cognitive problems in children with nf1. chemotherapy with vincristine and carboplatin is the current standard of care for symptomatic optic pathway gliomas, but new agents with improved efficacy are needed. plexiform neurofibromas may be treated with surgery, but often recur. to date, no medical therapy has proven effective in limiting plexiform neurofibroma growth, but several candidate medications are under consideration in clinical trials. malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors may arise in preexisting plexiform neurofibromas, so changes in tumor growth or an increase in pain or focal neurologic deficit should prompt further investigation and early treatment with wide surgical resection, with or without adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy. specialist surgical intervention may be needed for scoliosis and tibial pseudoarthrosis. in nf2, surgical treatment remains a cornerstone of management for symptomatic progressive vestibular schwannomas, meningiomas, and spinal tumors. vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors show promise for the treatment of vestibular schwannomas, with the aim of delaying surgery, and other targeted molecular therapies are becoming available as investigational options. hearing aids and brainstem and cochlear implants have a role in optimizing functional hearing in some patients. specialist ophthalmology input should be arranged to monitor for ophthalmologic complications. a coordinated effort is needed to enroll nf1 and nf2 patients in international multicenter clinical trials of promising new pharmacologic agents. genetic testing is useful for prenatal diagnosis and may be important in understanding individual responses to novel medical therapies in the future. effective transition to adult services is important, considering the likelihood of further complications in the adult years. © 2011 springer science+business media, llc.",4591,vincristine,pNF
